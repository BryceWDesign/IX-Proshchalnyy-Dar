# Clean Water Output: Purity Validation + System Noise Report  
> Subsystem: Final-stage water discharge logging, anomaly detection, acoustic profile logging

---

## 🚰 Purpose

Once the contaminated input water has been processed through:
- UV kill spiral reactor  
- Ion exchange stage  
- FIDA fractal beam lattice  
- Brush filter & vapor disposal…

...we **log** and **verify** that the **final output water** is clean and non-toxic, both chemically and electromagnetically.

## ✅ Water Purity Validation Module

### 📊 Sensors used:

| Sensor Type                | Measured Metric                 | Threshold for Clean Discharge |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| TDS sensor (0–5000 ppm)    | Total Dissolved Solids          | < 90 ppm                      |
| ORP (±2000 mV)             | Oxidation Reduction Potential   | > +300 mV                     |
| pH probe                   | Acidity                         | Between 6.5 and 8.2           |
| Turbidity (NTU)            | Particulate density             | < 1.0 NTU                     |
| EM background scanner      | Field residue from beam ops     | < 0.12 µT fluctuation         |
| Thermal delta sensor       | Discharge vs ambient difference | < ±2°C deviation              |

These are measured **every 6 seconds** during live flow, logged to flash memory, and optionally transmitted over telemetry uplink.

## 🔔 Acoustic/Visual Alert Triggers

### ✅ Green LED + Passive chirp
- Clean water discharge validated
- System running within stable envelope

### ⚠️ Yellow LED + Tone ping
- Output still safe but nearing impurity limits
- Suggest cleaning resin or checking ion exchange filter

### ❌ Red LED + Long dual-tone
- Output water exceeds safe limits
- Auto halt on discharge pump
- Initiates reroute to internal holding bin for reprocessing

## 🔊 Subsonic "System Noise" Logging

FIDA beams and ion exchange stages can leave minor acoustic EM imprints.

### System logs:
- 0–22 kHz ultrasonic anomalies
- Microphonic beamback patterns
- EM microflux caused by field collapse during resonance bounceback

All are logged to `logs/output_trace_*.bin` and reviewed during maintenance for:
- Field containment errors  
- Electrical overstress  
- Beam interference inside output lens chamber

---

## 🧬 Interlinks

This system connects to:
- `fida_beam_array/FIDA_ControlLogic.md`
- `ion_exchange/IonCapture_Logic.md`
- `uv_kill_reactor/DeepUV_ModuleSpecs.md`
- `telemetry/Warning_FailsafeLogic.md`

---

## 🔒 Safeguards

- Final output cannot be released if any two sensors fail
- Redundant sensor failover logic active
- Water that fails test is isolated into `sealed_bin_02/` for re-treatment
- External user cannot override purity lockout (tamper-proof)

---

## 📁 Field Data Logging Format

- CSV and binary log support
- Sample CSV:
```csv
timestamp,tds,orp,ph,turbidity,em_microtesla,thermal_delta
2025-07-25T12:45:03Z,58,+375,7.1,0.7,0.08,+1.4
```

---

## 📦 Maintenance Suggestion

- Sensor recalibration every 2 months (manual override port)
- Replace turbidity optical lens every 12 months (exposed to beam scatter)
- Optional data uplink module allows satellite sync if remote deployed

---

## Summary

This module **validates truthfully** that the output water is safe. No assumed purity. No fake compliance.  
Every drop is tracked, measured, and validated **in real time** with **real-world hardware**.
