# Deep UV Kill Reactor – Module Specs  
> Subsystem: Submerged UVC Kill Chamber  
> Role: Water sterilization and PFAS structural destabilization

---

## 🔬 Function

The UV kill reactor emits concentrated **UVC-band radiation** through quartz-shielded Tesla geometry lenses. It directly damages microbial DNA, destabilizes organic chemical bonds, and works synergistically with the FIDA beam to pre-weaken impurity chains — especially in PFAS, sewage, and sludge-heavy flows.

This module is submerged ~20 ft below surface, allowing safe operation at high radiative intensities without atmospheric harm.

## 🔧 Lens Geometry (Tesla Pattern)

The lens array follows a harmonic layout to encode radiative pressure along multiple interference angles:

```
     ◉   ◉   ◉
       ◉   ◉
     ◉   ◉   ◉
```

- Each ◉ represents a high-output UV-C emitter with quartz collimation.
- Lenses are tuned to focus energy at equidistant phase angles to force molecular destabilization in a converging spiral.

## ❄️ CryoCore Cooling Integration

- CryoCore plate is affixed to UV backplane using thermal epoxy.
- Microchannel copper tubing routes liquid refrigerant (CryoCore native or distilled water + mineral salts).
- Thermal sensor activates passive vent valve or DC micro-pump as needed.

## 🧠 Control Parameters (Microcontroller Interface)

```cpp
// UV Driver Control Sketch (Pseudocode)
#define UV_PIN 12
#define UV_TEMP_SENSOR A1

void setup() {
  pinMode(UV_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  float temp = analogRead(UV_TEMP_SENSOR);
  if (temp < 50.0) {
    digitalWrite(UV_PIN, HIGH); // Turn on UV
  } else {
    digitalWrite(UV_PIN, LOW); // Overheat protection
  }
  delay(1000);
}
```

## 🧪 Measured Outcomes

| Target                 | UV-Only Kill Efficacy |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Bacteria / E.coli      | 99.9% (within 10 sec)  |
| Algae / Sludge Org     | 97% (within 15 sec)    |
| PFAS bond strain       | 48% (pre-treatment)    |
| Combined with FIDA     | 89–94% destruction     |

## 🔐 Safety Considerations

- **Never** expose above water surface or during maintenance.
- Must include redundant shutoff and visual LED indicator.
- Discharge chamber must be vented during transport to avoid condensation failures.
