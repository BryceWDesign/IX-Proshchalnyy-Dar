# FIDA Beam Array ‚Äì Control Logic Specification

> Subsystem: Field-Intelligent Discharge Array (FIDA)  
> Role: Emit high-frequency, harmonically-tuned pulse discharges through contaminated water zones for PFAS and bonded impurity disruption.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

The FIDA subsystem functions as a **directed high-voltage, low-duration pulse driver**, using six beam rods arranged in a Tesla-style geometric pattern to deliver destructive harmonics through impurity-rich water. 

The goal: **break the molecular hold of PFAS-like chains**, disrupt residual radiation bonds, and precondition the fluid for ion exchange.

- Tip spacing: ~2.5 cm between nodes

### 2. **Capacitor Bank**
- Rated for fast-discharge, high-voltage tolerances
- Suggested: 2x 1000ŒºF @ 2000V electrolytic in parallel

### 3. **Discharge Trigger Circuit**
- Central ESP32 or STM32 microcontroller
- Trigger logic pins routed to opto-isolated MOSFET gates
- Each beam rod pair isolated through series inductance + diode trap

## üìê Tesla Harmonic Firing Logic

Tesla's 3-6-9 model governs the emission pattern:

```text
Rod 1, 4 ‚Äì fire together (3)
Rod 2, 5 ‚Äì fire together (6)
Rod 3, 6 ‚Äì fire together (9)
```

Each cycle emits harmonically interlaced charge vectors through the water medium, fracturing impurity clusters and stimulating realignment in surface charge behavior of bonded toxins.

## üß† ESP32 Control Code (Pseudocode Sketch)

```cpp
// FIDA Beam Control Loop ‚Äì Tesla Pattern
int pulseDuration = 25; // ms
int delayBetweenBursts = 300; // ms

void setup() {
  // Setup GPIO for pulse channels 1-6
  for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    pinMode(i, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(i, LOW);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Fire group 3 (1 + 4)
  digitalWrite(1, HIGH); digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
  delay(pulseDuration);
  digitalWrite(1, LOW); digitalWrite(4, LOW);
  delay(delayBetweenBursts);

  // Fire group 6 (2 + 5)
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH); digitalWrite(5, HIGH);
  delay(pulseDuration);
  digitalWrite(2, LOW); digitalWrite(5, LOW);
  delay(delayBetweenBursts);

  // Fire group 9 (3 + 6)
  digitalWrite(3, HIGH); digitalWrite(6, HIGH);
  delay(pulseDuration);
  digitalWrite(3, LOW); digitalWrite(6, LOW);
  delay(delayBetweenBursts);
}
```

## üîí Safety Protocols

- Interlock prevents re-fire within 150 ms of last burst
- Thermal sensor on capacitor bank to limit operation above 60¬∞C
- Power cutoff if water conductivity drops below viable threshold (open loop warning)
